# NYC Airbnb Market Trends 
 
This project aims to take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market, by attempting to answer key questions including:

1. What is the average price per night of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
2. How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
3. How many adverts are for private rooms?
4. How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?

The analysis was made using Python, and supporting packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
