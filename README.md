# NYC-Airbnb-Market-Trends

This project aims to take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market, by attempting to answer key questions including:

- What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
- How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
- How many adverts are for private rooms?
- How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?

The analysis was made using Python, and supporting packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
